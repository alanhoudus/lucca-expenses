## Go further 📈

- It'd have been better for the most recent data to be displayed first. Thought of it a bit late so it'd take longer. Could fix it by reversing the data on the API call.
- Converting the currency, couldn't find a free API, the one I found didn't propose to convert, or give rating of the currencies I wanted.
- Searchbar with id or by expense nature.
